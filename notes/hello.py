print("Hello World!")

# This goes hand in hand with the 'hello.bat' file, to demostrate its use. 
# Batch files just combine multiple files as one executable.
# I can use the run prompt (Win+R) to run batch files directly by typing 
# just the name of the .bat file, provided its folder is in the 
# path system variable. 
# If I want to run "hello.bat", I need to add C:\Python39\Python_Code\python_notes\notes\ 
# to the "path" system variable since hello.bat is located in that folder!
