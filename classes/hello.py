#! python3

print("Hello World!")


#batch files just combine multiple files as one executable.
#i can use the run prompt to run batch files directly by typing 
#just the name of the .bat file, provided its folder is in the 
#path system variable. if i want to run "hello.bat" i need to add 
#C:\Python39\Python_Code\python_notes\classes\ to the "path" system variable
#since hello.bat is located in that folder! 

#also to make the process a bit easier, when i installed python 3.9 i added
#an additional variable PYTHON3_HOME pointing to C:\python39 
#(the installation folder) so i can use %PYTHON3_HOME% in the 
#"path" system variable, instead of C:\python39. That makes it a bit easier.
