Rules:
1)Code Everyday: Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. consider starting small with 25 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
2)Go Interactive: The interactive Python shell will be one of your best learning tools.
3)Build Something, Anything: What you build is not as important as how you build it. The journey of building is truly what will teach you the most. The problems you will solve will teach you a lot.There are many lists out there with ideas for beginner Python projects.
4)When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts.you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.

Tips:
Have patience.
Frustration and pain is a part of learning proces.
Errors/ issues are expected, donâ€™t let that discourage you from learning.
Once again, be consistent.
